Directions to run application:
Launch the application, enter your username and password on the login screen, follow the buttons to navigate to the
windows of the application you want to interact with. Every screen has a button to take you back to the Main Menu.
To exit the application, simply exit via the 'x' on the top of the application window on any screen.

Additional Report I included in part A3f:
I added an input to enter a user ID and request the total number of appointments that the specified user has
scheduled in the database, past and present.
